Once TCR has begun its own review process on a successfully-submitted Campaign, the Campaign will be IN_PROGRESS until that review has finished. At that point the campaign_status will be either VERIFIED (approved) or FAILED (rejected).\n\nIf campaign_status is FAILED, the response will contain an “errors” attribute with the information on why the registration failed (this errors[] attribute is present in the return for other statuses as well, but will be empty) .

This may add a slight delay in sending the message.\nTwilio caches files when HTTP headers allow it (via ETag and Last-Modified headers). Responding with Cache-Control: no-cache ensures Twilio always checks if the file has changed, allowing your web server to respond with a new version or with a 304 Not Modified to instruct Twilio to use its cached version.\nRate this page:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNeed some help?\n\nWe all do sometimes; code is hard.

The possible statuses for campaigns will vary depending on what stage the Campaign is at in the review process. A newly-created Campaign that has yet to be considered by TCR will be PENDING, assuming that the Twilio API itself has accepted it (i.e., all the data is basically conforming); otherwise it will be FAILED. Once TCR has begun its own review process on a successfully-submitted Campaign, the Campaign will be IN_PROGRESS until that review has finished. At that point the campaign_status will be either VERIFIED (approved) or FAILED (rejected).\n\nIf campaign_status is FAILED, the response will contain an “errors” attribute with the information on why the registration failed (this errors[] attribute is present in the return for other statuses as well, but will be empty) . The populated errors[] attribute is particularly helpful if the campaign registration failed during Twilio’s internal review or External campaign review by our partners.\n\nIf your Campaign is marked as FAILED, please see this Guide to Troubleshooting A2P Brands and Campaigns to understand Campaign error messages and how to rectify these\n\nFetch a list of possible US A2P Campaign Use Cases\n\nTo fetch a list of possible US A2P campaign use cases for a Messaging Service, provide the BrandRegistrationSID (BNXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) as shown in Example 2.\n\nIf you haven not yet created a brand, please see one of the following US A2P ISV API guides on how to do so:\n\nStep 3 Create a US A2P Brand in the the ISV Standard API Walkthrough\nStep 3 Create a US A2P Brand in the ISV Sole Proprietor API Walkthrough\n\nFor more information on possible campaign use cases for Messaging Services, head over to the US App to Person Messaging Service Use Case Resource.\n\nExample 2\nFetch a list of possible US A2P Campaign Use Cases\nRead a List of US A2P Campaigns associated with a Messaging Service\nGET https://messaging.twilio.com/v1/Services/{MessagingServiceSid}/Compliance/Usa2p\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\nmessagingServiceSid\nPath\nGET SID<MG> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Messaging Service to fetch the resource from.\n\nExample 1\nRead a List of US A2P Campaigns associated with a Messaging Service\nDelete a US A2P Campaign\nDELETE https://messaging.twilio.com/v1/Services/{MessagingServiceSid}/Compliance/Usa2p/{Sid}\n\nNote: The value of Sid will always be the US A2P Compliance resource identifier: QE2c6890da8086d771620e9b13fadeba0b.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\nmessagingServiceSid\nPath\nDELETE SID<MG> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Messaging Service to delete the resource from.\n\nsid\nPath\nDELETE SID<QE> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the US A2P Compliance resource to delete QE2c6890da8086d771620e9b13fadeba0b.\n\nExample 1\nDelete a US A2P Campaign\nRate this page:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNeed some help?\n\nWe all do sometimes; code is hard.

If you are using a Messaging Service for this use case, it is important to understand that once your Campaign has been approved by the A2P ecosystem, you should NOT subsequently delete the associated Messaging Service as this will also delete the Campaign itself, which will immediately de-register any 10DLC senders in that MS and thus halt their ability to message within the U.S., until a new Campaign can be registered using those same 10DLC numbers.\n\nThis warning applies ONLY to the US A2P 10DLC use case. It does not apply to Messaging Services used for messaging outsider of the U.S., or to Messaging Services using Toll Free numbers, short codes or WhatsApp senders. To learn more about A2P US 10DLC registration, please see this guide.\n\nTwilio is working on making A2P registration a more straightforward user experience moving forward.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\nsid\nPath\nDELETE SID<MG> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Service resource to delete.\n\nExample 1\nDelete Service\nRate this page:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNeed some help?\n\nWe all do sometimes; code is hard.

This ensures your body text transmits with the highest fidelity.\n\nOn inbound SMS messages, this property indicates the number of SMS messages that make up the message received.\n\nIf the body of a message is more than 160 GSM-7 characters (or 70 UCS-2 characters), Twilio attempts to reassemble the message received by your Twilio phone number. All carriers and handsets do not necessarily support this.\n\nYour account is charged for each segment sent or received.\n\nLearn more on the SMS Character Limit Glossary page.\n\nCreate a Message resource\nPOST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json\n\nTo send a new outgoing message, send an HTTP POST request to your Account's Messages list resource URI.\n\nIf you want to send messages while in trial mode, you must first verify your 'To' phone number with Twilio. You can verify your phone number by adding it to your Verified Caller IDs in the Console.\n\nTwilio queues messages for delivery at your prescribed rate limit. API requests for messages that exceed the specified rates will be queued and executed as capacity is available.\n\nIf you need to enqueue a large number of messages, you may want to use Messaging Services.\n\nEvery request to create a new Message resource requires a recipient, a sender, and content.\n\nA recipient is specified via the To parameter.\n\nThe sender is specified via one of the following parameters:\n\nFrom\nMessagingServiceSid\n\nThe message content is specified via one of the following parameters:\n\nMediaUrl\nBody\nContentSid\n\nThe table below describes these parameters in more detail.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nPOST SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account creating the Message resource.\n\nto\nRequired\nPOST STRING<HELPERS_TYPE=PHONE_NUMBER> PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nThe recipient's phone number in E.164 format (for SMS/MMS) or channel address, e.g. whatsapp:+15552229999.\n\nstatusCallback\nOptional\nPOST STRING<HELPERS_TYPE=URL> NOT PII\n\nThe URL of the endpoint to which Twilio sends Message status callback requests. URL must contain a valid hostname and underscores are not allowed. If you include this parameter with the messaging_service_sid, Twilio uses this URL instead of the Status Callback URL of the Messaging Service.\n\napplicationSid\nOptional\nPOST SID<AP> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the associated TwiML Application. If this parameter is provided, the status_callback parameter of this request is ignored; Message status callback requests are sent to the TwiML App's message_status_callback URL.\n\nmaxPrice\nOptional\nPOST CURRENCY<HELPERS_TYPE=DECIMAL> NOT PII\n\nThe maximum price in US dollars that you are willing to pay for this Message's delivery. The value can have up to four decimal places. When the max_price parameter is provided, the cost of a message is checked before it is sent. If the cost exceeds max_price, the message is not sent and the Message status is failed.\n\nprovideFeedback\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nBoolean indicating whether or not you intend to provide delivery confirmation feedback to Twilio (used in conjunction with the Message Feedback subresource). Default value is false.\n\nattempt\nOptional\nPOST INTEGER NOT PII\n\nTotal number of attempts made (including this request) to send the message regardless of the provider used\n\nvalidityPeriod\nOptional\nPOST INTEGER NOT PII\n\nThe maximum length in seconds that the Message can remain in Twilio's outgoing message queue. If a queued Message exceeds the validity_period, the Message is not sent. Accepted values are integers from 1 to 14400. Default value is 14400. A validity_period greater than 5 is recommended. Learn more about the validity period\n\nforceDelivery\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nReserved\n\ncontentRetention\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:CONTENT_RETENTION NOT PII\n\nDetermines if the message content can be stored or redacted based on privacy settings\n\naddressRetention\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:ADDRESS_RETENTION NOT PII\n\nDetermines if the address can be stored or obfuscated based on privacy settings\n\nsmartEncoded\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nWhether to detect Unicode characters that have a similar GSM-7 character and replace them. Can be: true or false.\n\npersistentAction\nOptional\nPOST STRING[] NOT PII\n\nRich actions for non-SMS/MMS channels. Used for sending location in WhatsApp messages.\n\nshortenUrls\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nFor Messaging Services with Link Shortening configured only: A Boolean indicating whether or not Twilio should shorten links in the body of the Message. Default value is false. If true, the messaging_service_sid parameter must also be provided.\n\nscheduleType\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:SCHEDULE_TYPE NOT PII\n\nFor Messaging Services only: Include this parameter with a value of fixed in conjuction with the send_time parameter in order to schedule a Message.\n\nsendAt\nOptional\nPOST DATE_TIME<ISO8601> NOT PII\n\nThe time that Twilio will send the message. Must be in ISO 8601 format.\n\nsendAsMms\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nIf set to true, Twilio delivers the message as a single MMS message, regardless of the presence of media.\n\ncontentVariables\nOptional\nPOST STRING NOT PII\n\nFor Content Editor/API only: Key-value pairs of Template variables and their substitution values. content_sid parameter must also be provided. If values are not defined in the content_variables parameter, the Template's default placeholder values are used.\n\nriskCheck\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:RISK_CHECK NOT PII\n\nFor SMS pumping protection feature only: Include this parameter with a value of disable to skip any kind of risk check on the respective message request.\n\nfrom\nRequired if messagingServiceSid is not passed\nPOST STRING<HELPERS_TYPE=PHONE_NUMBER> PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nThe sender's Twilio phone number (in E.164 format), alphanumeric sender ID, Wireless SIM, short code, or channel address (e.g., whatsapp:+15554449999). The value of the from parameter must be a sender that is hosted within Twilio and belongs to the Account creating the Message. If you are using messaging_service_sid, this parameter can be empty (Twilio assigns a from value from the Messaging Service's Sender Pool) or you can provide a specific sender from your Sender Pool.\n\nmessagingServiceSid\nRequired if from is not passed\nPOST SID<MG> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Messaging Service you want to associate with the Message. When this parameter is provided and the from parameter is omitted, Twilio selects the optimal sender from the Messaging Service's Sender Pool. You may also provide a from parameter if you want to use a specific Sender from the Sender Pool.\n\nbody\nRequired if mediaUrl contentSid is not passed\nPOST STRING PII MTL: 30 DAYS\n\nThe text content of the outgoing message. Can be up to 1,600 characters in length. SMS only: If the body contains more than 160 GSM-7 characters (or 70 UCS-2 characters), the message is segmented and charged accordingly. For long body text, consider using the send_as_mms parameter.\n\nmediaUrl\nRequired if body contentSid is not passed\nPOST URL[] PII MTL: 30 DAYS\n\nThe URL of media to include in the Message content. jpeg, jpg, gif, and png file types are fully supported by Twilio and content is formatted for delivery on destination devices. The media size limit is 5 MB for supported file types (jpeg, jpg, png, gif) and 500 KB for other types of accepted media. To send more than one image in the message, provide multiple media_url parameters in the POST request. You can include up to ten media_url parameters per message. International and carrier limits apply.\n\ncontentSid\nRequired if body mediaUrl is not passed\nPOST SID<HX> NOT PII\n\nFor Content Editor/API only: The SID of the Content Template to be used with the Message, e.g., HXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. If this parameter is not provided, a Content Template is not used. Find the SID in the Console on the Content Editor page. For Content API users, the SID is found in Twilio's response when creating the Template or by fetching your Templates.\n\nTwilio's request to the StatusCallback URL\n\nWhenever a Message resource's Status changes, Twilio sends a POST request to the Message resource's StatusCallback URL.\n\nIn a status callback request, Twilio provides a subset of the standard request properties, and additionally MessageStatus and ErrorCode. These properties are described in the table below.\n\nProperty\tDescription\nMessageStatus\tThe status of the Message resource at the time the status callback request was sent.\nErrorCode\tIf an error occurred (i.e. the MessageStatus is failed or undelivered), this property provides additional information about the failure.\n\nThe properties included in Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL vary by messaging channel and event type and are subject to change.\n\nTwilio occasionally adds new properties without advance notice.\n\nWhen integrating with status callback requests, it is important that your implementation is able to accept and correctly run signature validation on an evolving set of parameters.\n\nTwilio strongly recommends using the signature validation methods provided in the Helper Libraries and not implementing your own signature validation.\n\nSMS/MMS\n\nFor most SMS/MMS Messages that have a Status of delivered or undelivered, Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL contains an additional property:\n\nProperty\tDescription\nRawDlrDoneDate\t\n\nThis property is a passthrough of the Done Date included in the DLR (Delivery Receipt) that Twilio received from the carrier.\n\nThe value is in YYMMDDhhmm format.\n\nYY is last two digits of the year (00-99)\n MM is the two-digit month (01-12)\n DD is the two-digit day (01-31)\nhh is the two-digit hour (00-23)\n mm is the two-digit minute (00-59).\nLearn more on the \"Addition of RawDlrDoneDate to Delivered and Undelivered Status Webhooks\" Changelog page.\n\nWhatsApp and other messaging channels\n\nIf the Message resource uses WhatsApp or another messaging channel, Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL contains additional properties. These properties are listed in the table below.\n\nProperty\tDescription\nChannelInstallSid\tThe Installed Channel SID that was used to send this message\nChannelStatusMessage\tThe error message returned by the underlying messaging channel if Message delivery failed. This property is present only if the Message delivery failed.\nChannelPrefix\tThe channel-specific prefix identifying the messaging channel associated with this Message\nEventType\t\n\nThis property contains information about post-delivery events.\n\nIf the channel supports read receipts (currently WhatsApp only), this property's value is READ after the recipient has read the message.\n\nSend an SMS message\n\nThe example below shows how to create a Message resource with an SMS recipient.\n\nSending this POST request causes Twilio to send a text message from +15557122661 (a Twilio phone number belonging to the Account sending the request) to +15558675310. The content of the text message is Hi there.\n\nExample 1\nSend an SMS message\nSend a WhatsApp message\n\nIf you have a Twilio-approved WhatsApp sender, you can send WhatsApp messages by creating a new Message resource. (WhatsApp session limitations apply.)\n\nThe From parameter value must be your approved WhatsApp sender address (e.g., whatsapp:+15552221111).\n\nThe To parameter value must be a WhatsApp recipient address (e.g., whatsapp:+15553334444).\n\nYou must also provide message content via the Body and/or MediaUrl parameters.\n\nIf you're using Messaging Services with Content API/Content Editor, you can provide message content via the contentSid and contentVariables parameters.\n\nNote: WhatsApp does not support including a text body in the same message as a video, audio file, document, contact (vCard), or location. If you pass the Body parameter on a message with one of these media types, the body is ignored and not delivered to the recipient.\n\nExample 2\nSend a WhatsApp Message\nSend a message with a Messaging Service\n\nWhen sending a message with a Messaging Service, you must provide a recipient via the To parameter and content via the Body, ContentSid, or MediaUrl parameters. In addition, you must provide the MessagingServiceSid.\n\nIf you provide a MessagingServiceSid and no From parameter, Twilio determines the optimal From value from your Sender Pool. In this case, the Message resource's initial Status value is accepted.\n\nOptionally, you can provide a MessagingServiceSid and a From parameter. The From parameter must be a sender from your Messaging Service's Sender Pool. In this case, the Message resource's initial Status value is queued.\n\nWith Messaging Services, you can also schedule messages to be sent in the future and send messages with shortened links.\n\nExample 3\nSend a message with a Messaging Service\nFetch a Message resource\nGET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json\n\nReturns a single Message resource specified by the provided Message SID.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nGET SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account associated with the Message resource\n\nsid\nPath\nGET SID<MM> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Message resource to be fetched\n\nExample 1\nFetch Message\nRead multiple Message resources\nGET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json\n\nRead multiple Message resources by sending a GET request to your Account's Messages list URI.\n\nResults are sorted by the DateSent field, with the most recent messages appearing first.\n\nIf you are using the Twilio REST API and plan on requesting more records than will fit on a single page, you may want to use the response's nextpageuri property. Requesting this URI ensures that your next request picks up where it left off and can prevent you from retrieving duplicate data if you are actively sending or receiving messages.\n\nThis is not necessary if you are using one of the Helper Libraries, which automatically handle pagination. Take a look at the Helper Library documentation for more information.\n\nYou can also filter the Messages list by providing the following query string parameters to the listing resource:\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nGET SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account associated with the Message resources.\n\nto\nOptional\nGET PHONE_NUMBER PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nFilter by recipient. For example: Set this to parameter to +15558881111 to retrieve a list of Message resources with to properties of +15558881111\n\nfrom\nOptional\nGET PHONE_NUMBER PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nFilter by sender. For example: Set this from parameter to +15552229999 to retrieve a list of Message resources with from properties of +15552229999\n\ndateSent\nOptional\nGET DATE_TIME_INEQUALITY<ISO8601> NOT PII\n\nFilter by Message sent_date. Accepts GMT dates in the following formats: YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with a specific sent_date), <=YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with sent_dates on and before a specific date), and >=YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with sent_dates on and after a specific date).\n\nExample 1\nList all Message resources\nReturns a list of all Message resources associated with your Account\nExample 2\nList Message resources matching filter criteria\nList all messages sent on August 31, 2016 from +15017122661 and to +15558675310\nExample 3\nList Messages that were sent before a specific date\nList all Messages sent before March 1st, 2019\nExample 4\nList Messages within a specific time period\nList all Messages sent between January 15th, 2021, 01:23:45 UTC and January 17th, 2021, 01:23:45 UTC\nUpdate a Message resource\nPOST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json\n\nUpdates the body of a Message resource. Send a POST request to a Message resource's URI containing the updated parameters.\n\nThis action is primarily used to redact Message content. To redact a Message resources's Body, send a POST request to the Message resource's URI and set the Body parameter as an empty string: \"\". This redacts the Body of a message while keeping the other Message resource properties intact.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nPOST SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account that created the Message resources to update.\n\nsid\nPath\nPOST SID<MM> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Message resource to be updated\n\nbody\nOptional\nPOST STRING PII MTL: 30 DAYS\n\nThe new body of the Message resource. To redact the text content of a Message, this parameter's value must be an empty string\n\nstatus\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:UPDATE_STATUS NOT PII\n\nSet as canceled to prevent a not-yet-sent Message from being sent. Can be used to cancel sending a scheduled Message (Messaging Services only).\n\nExample 1\nRedact the body of a Message resource\nDelete a Message resource\nDELETE https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json\n\nTo delete a Message resource, send a DELETE request to the Message resource's URI.\n\nIf the DELETE request is successful, Twilio's response status code is HTTP 204 (No Content).\n\nA deleted Message resource no longer appears in your Account's Messaging logs. Deleted messages cannot be recovered.\n\nDeleting a Message resource also deletes any associated Media and/or MessageFeedback sub-resources. Any associated media file is also deleted unless the same media file is associated with another Message resource in your Account. For example, if you send 1,000 messages with the same media file (e.g., a .jpeg file), that media file remains accessible until all 1,000 associated Message resources (and/or the associated Media sub-resources) are deleted.\n\nMessage bodies may persist for up to 30 days after an HTTP DELETE request in our database backups.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nDELETE SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account associated with the Message resource\n\nsid\nPath\nDELETE SID<MM> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Message resource you wish to delete\n\nExample 1\nDelete Message\nRate this page:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNeed some help?\n\nWe all do sometimes; code is hard.

This ensures your body text transmits with the highest fidelity.\n\nOn inbound SMS messages, this property indicates the number of SMS messages that make up the message received.\n\nIf the body of a message is more than 160 GSM-7 characters (or 70 UCS-2 characters), Twilio attempts to reassemble the message received by your Twilio phone number. All carriers and handsets do not necessarily support this.\n\nYour account is charged for each segment sent or received.\n\nLearn more on the SMS Character Limit Glossary page.\n\nCreate a Message resource\nPOST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json\n\nTo send a new outgoing message, send an HTTP POST request to your Account's Messages list resource URI.\n\nIf you want to send messages while in trial mode, you must first verify your 'To' phone number with Twilio. You can verify your phone number by adding it to your Verified Caller IDs in the Console.\n\nTwilio queues messages for delivery at your prescribed rate limit. API requests for messages that exceed the specified rates will be queued and executed as capacity is available.\n\nIf you need to enqueue a large number of messages, you may want to use Messaging Services.\n\nEvery request to create a new Message resource requires a recipient, a sender, and content.\n\nA recipient is specified via the To parameter.\n\nThe sender is specified via one of the following parameters:\n\nFrom\nMessagingServiceSid\n\nThe message content is specified via one of the following parameters:\n\nMediaUrl\nBody\nContentSid\n\nThe table below describes these parameters in more detail.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nPOST SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account creating the Message resource.\n\nto\nRequired\nPOST STRING<HELPERS_TYPE=PHONE_NUMBER> PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nThe recipient's phone number in E.164 format (for SMS/MMS) or channel address, e.g. whatsapp:+15552229999.\n\nstatusCallback\nOptional\nPOST STRING<HELPERS_TYPE=URL> NOT PII\n\nThe URL of the endpoint to which Twilio sends Message status callback requests. URL must contain a valid hostname and underscores are not allowed. If you include this parameter with the messaging_service_sid, Twilio uses this URL instead of the Status Callback URL of the Messaging Service.\n\napplicationSid\nOptional\nPOST SID<AP> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the associated TwiML Application. If this parameter is provided, the status_callback parameter of this request is ignored; Message status callback requests are sent to the TwiML App's message_status_callback URL.\n\nmaxPrice\nOptional\nPOST CURRENCY<HELPERS_TYPE=DECIMAL> NOT PII\n\nThe maximum price in US dollars that you are willing to pay for this Message's delivery. The value can have up to four decimal places. When the max_price parameter is provided, the cost of a message is checked before it is sent. If the cost exceeds max_price, the message is not sent and the Message status is failed.\n\nprovideFeedback\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nBoolean indicating whether or not you intend to provide delivery confirmation feedback to Twilio (used in conjunction with the Message Feedback subresource). Default value is false.\n\nattempt\nOptional\nPOST INTEGER NOT PII\n\nTotal number of attempts made (including this request) to send the message regardless of the provider used\n\nvalidityPeriod\nOptional\nPOST INTEGER NOT PII\n\nThe maximum length in seconds that the Message can remain in Twilio's outgoing message queue. If a queued Message exceeds the validity_period, the Message is not sent. Accepted values are integers from 1 to 14400. Default value is 14400. A validity_period greater than 5 is recommended. Learn more about the validity period\n\nforceDelivery\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nReserved\n\ncontentRetention\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:CONTENT_RETENTION NOT PII\n\nDetermines if the message content can be stored or redacted based on privacy settings\n\naddressRetention\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:ADDRESS_RETENTION NOT PII\n\nDetermines if the address can be stored or obfuscated based on privacy settings\n\nsmartEncoded\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nWhether to detect Unicode characters that have a similar GSM-7 character and replace them. Can be: true or false.\n\npersistentAction\nOptional\nPOST STRING[] NOT PII\n\nRich actions for non-SMS/MMS channels. Used for sending location in WhatsApp messages.\n\nshortenUrls\nOptional\nPOST BOOLEAN NOT PII\n\nFor Messaging Services with Link Shortening configured only: A Boolean indicating whether or not Twilio should shorten links in the body of the Message.

If values are not defined in the content_variables parameter, the Template's default placeholder values are used.\n\nriskCheck\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:RISK_CHECK NOT PII\n\nFor SMS pumping protection feature only: Include this parameter with a value of disable to skip any kind of risk check on the respective message request.\n\nfrom\nRequired if messagingServiceSid is not passed\nPOST STRING<HELPERS_TYPE=PHONE_NUMBER> PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nThe sender's Twilio phone number (in E.164 format), alphanumeric sender ID, Wireless SIM, short code, or channel address (e.g., whatsapp:+15554449999). The value of the from parameter must be a sender that is hosted within Twilio and belongs to the Account creating the Message. If you are using messaging_service_sid, this parameter can be empty (Twilio assigns a from value from the Messaging Service's Sender Pool) or you can provide a specific sender from your Sender Pool.\n\nmessagingServiceSid\nRequired if from is not passed\nPOST SID<MG> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Messaging Service you want to associate with the Message. When this parameter is provided and the from parameter is omitted, Twilio selects the optimal sender from the Messaging Service's Sender Pool. You may also provide a from parameter if you want to use a specific Sender from the Sender Pool.\n\nbody\nRequired if mediaUrl contentSid is not passed\nPOST STRING PII MTL: 30 DAYS\n\nThe text content of the outgoing message. Can be up to 1,600 characters in length. SMS only: If the body contains more than 160 GSM-7 characters (or 70 UCS-2 characters), the message is segmented and charged accordingly. For long body text, consider using the send_as_mms parameter.\n\nmediaUrl\nRequired if body contentSid is not passed\nPOST URL[] PII MTL: 30 DAYS\n\nThe URL of media to include in the Message content. jpeg, jpg, gif, and png file types are fully supported by Twilio and content is formatted for delivery on destination devices. The media size limit is 5 MB for supported file types (jpeg, jpg, png, gif) and 500 KB for other types of accepted media. To send more than one image in the message, provide multiple media_url parameters in the POST request. You can include up to ten media_url parameters per message. International and carrier limits apply.\n\ncontentSid\nRequired if body mediaUrl is not passed\nPOST SID<HX> NOT PII\n\nFor Content Editor/API only: The SID of the Content Template to be used with the Message, e.g., HXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. If this parameter is not provided, a Content Template is not used. Find the SID in the Console on the Content Editor page. For Content API users, the SID is found in Twilio's response when creating the Template or by fetching your Templates.\n\nTwilio's request to the StatusCallback URL\n\nWhenever a Message resource's Status changes, Twilio sends a POST request to the Message resource's StatusCallback URL.\n\nIn a status callback request, Twilio provides a subset of the standard request properties, and additionally MessageStatus and ErrorCode. These properties are described in the table below.\n\nProperty\tDescription\nMessageStatus\tThe status of the Message resource at the time the status callback request was sent.\nErrorCode\tIf an error occurred (i.e. the MessageStatus is failed or undelivered), this property provides additional information about the failure.\n\nThe properties included in Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL vary by messaging channel and event type and are subject to change.\n\nTwilio occasionally adds new properties without advance notice.\n\nWhen integrating with status callback requests, it is important that your implementation is able to accept and correctly run signature validation on an evolving set of parameters.\n\nTwilio strongly recommends using the signature validation methods provided in the Helper Libraries and not implementing your own signature validation.\n\nSMS/MMS\n\nFor most SMS/MMS Messages that have a Status of delivered or undelivered, Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL contains an additional property:\n\nProperty\tDescription\nRawDlrDoneDate\t\n\nThis property is a passthrough of the Done Date included in the DLR (Delivery Receipt) that Twilio received from the carrier.\n\nThe value is in YYMMDDhhmm format.\n\nYY is last two digits of the year (00-99)\n MM is the two-digit month (01-12)\n DD is the two-digit day (01-31)\nhh is the two-digit hour (00-23)\n mm is the two-digit minute (00-59).\nLearn more on the \"Addition of RawDlrDoneDate to Delivered and Undelivered Status Webhooks\" Changelog page.\n\nWhatsApp and other messaging channels\n\nIf the Message resource uses WhatsApp or another messaging channel, Twilio's request to the StatusCallback URL contains additional properties. These properties are listed in the table below.\n\nProperty\tDescription\nChannelInstallSid\tThe Installed Channel SID that was used to send this message\nChannelStatusMessage\tThe error message returned by the underlying messaging channel if Message delivery failed. This property is present only if the Message delivery failed.\nChannelPrefix\tThe channel-specific prefix identifying the messaging channel associated with this Message\nEventType\t\n\nThis property contains information about post-delivery events.\n\nIf the channel supports read receipts (currently WhatsApp only), this property's value is READ after the recipient has read the message.\n\nSend an SMS message\n\nThe example below shows how to create a Message resource with an SMS recipient.\n\nSending this POST request causes Twilio to send a text message from +15557122661 (a Twilio phone number belonging to the Account sending the request) to +15558675310. The content of the text message is Hi there.\n\nExample 1\nSend an SMS message\nSend a WhatsApp message\n\nIf you have a Twilio-approved WhatsApp sender, you can send WhatsApp messages by creating a new Message resource. (WhatsApp session limitations apply.)\n\nThe From parameter value must be your approved WhatsApp sender address (e.g., whatsapp:+15552221111).\n\nThe To parameter value must be a WhatsApp recipient address (e.g., whatsapp:+15553334444).\n\nYou must also provide message content via the Body and/or MediaUrl parameters.\n\nIf you're using Messaging Services with Content API/Content Editor, you can provide message content via the contentSid and contentVariables parameters.\n\nNote: WhatsApp does not support including a text body in the same message as a video, audio file, document, contact (vCard), or location. If you pass the Body parameter on a message with one of these media types, the body is ignored and not delivered to the recipient.\n\nExample 2\nSend a WhatsApp Message\nSend a message with a Messaging Service\n\nWhen sending a message with a Messaging Service, you must provide a recipient via the To parameter and content via the Body, ContentSid, or MediaUrl parameters. In addition, you must provide the MessagingServiceSid.\n\nIf you provide a MessagingServiceSid and no From parameter, Twilio determines the optimal From value from your Sender Pool. In this case, the Message resource's initial Status value is accepted.\n\nOptionally, you can provide a MessagingServiceSid and a From parameter. The From parameter must be a sender from your Messaging Service's Sender Pool. In this case, the Message resource's initial Status value is queued.\n\nWith Messaging Services, you can also schedule messages to be sent in the future and send messages with shortened links.\n\nExample 3\nSend a message with a Messaging Service\nFetch a Message resource\nGET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json\n\nReturns a single Message resource specified by the provided Message SID.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nGET SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account associated with the Message resource\n\nsid\nPath\nGET SID<MM> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Message resource to be fetched\n\nExample 1\nFetch Message\nRead multiple Message resources\nGET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages.json\n\nRead multiple Message resources by sending a GET request to your Account's Messages list URI.\n\nResults are sorted by the DateSent field, with the most recent messages appearing first.\n\nIf you are using the Twilio REST API and plan on requesting more records than will fit on a single page, you may want to use the response's nextpageuri property. Requesting this URI ensures that your next request picks up where it left off and can prevent you from retrieving duplicate data if you are actively sending or receiving messages.\n\nThis is not necessary if you are using one of the Helper Libraries, which automatically handle pagination. Take a look at the Helper Library documentation for more information.\n\nYou can also filter the Messages list by providing the following query string parameters to the listing resource:\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nGET SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account associated with the Message resources.\n\nto\nOptional\nGET PHONE_NUMBER PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nFilter by recipient. For example: Set this to parameter to +15558881111 to retrieve a list of Message resources with to properties of +15558881111\n\nfrom\nOptional\nGET PHONE_NUMBER PII MTL: 120 DAYS\n\nFilter by sender. For example: Set this from parameter to +15552229999 to retrieve a list of Message resources with from properties of +15552229999\n\ndateSent\nOptional\nGET DATE_TIME_INEQUALITY<ISO8601> NOT PII\n\nFilter by Message sent_date. Accepts GMT dates in the following formats: YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with a specific sent_date), <=YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with sent_dates on and before a specific date), and >=YYYY-MM-DD (to find Messages with sent_dates on and after a specific date).\n\nExample 1\nList all Message resources\nReturns a list of all Message resources associated with your Account\nExample 2\nList Message resources matching filter criteria\nList all messages sent on August 31, 2016 from +15017122661 and to +15558675310\nExample 3\nList Messages that were sent before a specific date\nList all Messages sent before March 1st, 2019\nExample 4\nList Messages within a specific time period\nList all Messages sent between January 15th, 2021, 01:23:45 UTC and January 17th, 2021, 01:23:45 UTC\nUpdate a Message resource\nPOST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json\n\nUpdates the body of a Message resource. Send a POST request to a Message resource's URI containing the updated parameters.\n\nThis action is primarily used to redact Message content. To redact a Message resources's Body, send a POST request to the Message resource's URI and set the Body parameter as an empty string: \"\". This redacts the Body of a message while keeping the other Message resource properties intact.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nPOST SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account that created the Message resources to update.\n\nsid\nPath\nPOST SID<MM> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Message resource to be updated\n\nbody\nOptional\nPOST STRING PII MTL: 30 DAYS\n\nThe new body of the Message resource. To redact the text content of a Message, this parameter's value must be an empty string\n\nstatus\nOptional\nPOST IENUM:UPDATE_STATUS NOT PII\n\nSet as canceled to prevent a not-yet-sent Message from being sent. Can be used to cancel sending a scheduled Message (Messaging Services only).\n\nExample 1\nRedact the body of a Message resource\nDelete a Message resource\nDELETE https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Messages/{Sid}.json\n\nTo delete a Message resource, send a DELETE request to the Message resource's URI.\n\nIf the DELETE request is successful, Twilio's response status code is HTTP 204 (No Content).\n\nA deleted Message resource no longer appears in your Account's Messaging logs. Deleted messages cannot be recovered.\n\nDeleting a Message resource also deletes any associated Media and/or MessageFeedback sub-resources. Any associated media file is also deleted unless the same media file is associated with another Message resource in your Account. For example, if you send 1,000 messages with the same media file (e.g., a .jpeg file), that media file remains accessible until all 1,000 associated Message resources (and/or the associated Media sub-resources) are deleted.\n\nMessage bodies may persist for up to 30 days after an HTTP DELETE request in our database backups.\n\nParameters\nParameters in Node.js format\naccountSid\nPath\nDELETE SID<AC> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Account associated with the Message resource\n\nsid\nPath\nDELETE SID<MM> NOT PII\n\nThe SID of the Message resource you wish to delete\n\nExample 1\nDelete Message\nRate this page:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNeed some help?\n\nWe all do sometimes; code is hard.
