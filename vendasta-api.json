    "html": "Request a Review for a Business Location\n\nThis guide relies on \"Trusted Tester\" endpoints and is likely to change until all features have been made generally available.\n\nWith Customer Voice, you can gather authentic reviews via email or text on the sites that matter most, to grow customer loyalty and boost sales.\n\nLearn more about Customer Voice\n\nSetup\n\nCreate an access token with reviews and customers scopes following the Authorization guide.\n\nHave an activated Customer Voice product and SMS add-on if you need to send SMS review requests. Ensure your email and SMS templates are configured appropriately and your preferred review sites are configured within the Customer Voice platform.\n\nStep 1: Obtain a Template ID\n\nTemplates control the text and layout of your review request and can be configured to dynamically populate fields from your business information, a customer record or your preferred review sites.\n\nTo obtain a template ID, navigate to the \"Templates\" tab and select \"Edit Template\" from the configuration menu of your chosen template.\n\nScrolling to the bottom of the \"Edit Template\" page you will see a button for copying the template ID. If you do not see this button, contact your support person to enable this or copy the template ID from the URL bar.\n\nThis will copy a string in the form of TEM-d2f4cf1aa7ae480bbf0a2da67dxxxxxx.\n\nWhen sending a review request you can also provide a \"fallback\" template to use in the case where we are unable to send a review request with the primary template. This may occur if, for example, sending the review request would cause you to exceed your monthly SMS limit. If an email fallback template is provided we would send an email review request instead.\n\nTemplates are unique to a business location: if you are sending a review request for one business location you cannot use the template ID from another. Once you've obtained your template ID for the business location you are sending a review request for, you can continue to use that ID even if you update the underlying template within Customer Voice.\n\nStep 2: Obtain a Vendasta Customer ID\n\nIn order to track the status of a review request within Customer Voice, a Vendasta customer record must exist and the ID of this record must be provided. To sync contact information from your system to Vendasta's you can use the /business/customers endpoint.\n\nRequest\nCustomer Created Response\nCustomer Conflict Response\nPOST\nhttps://prod.apigateway.co/business/customers\nParameters\nAuthorization*\n:\nContent-Type*\n:\nBody\n1\n{\n2\n  \"data\": {\n3\n    \"type\": \"customers\",\n4\n    \"attributes\": {\n5\n      \"givenName\": \"William\",\n6\n      \"familyName\": \"Smith\",\n7\n      \"address\": {\n8\n        \"streetAddress\": \"123 Fake St.\",\n9\n        \"city\": \"Kalamazoo\",\n10\n        \"regionCode\": \"US-MI\",\n11\n        \"countryCode\": \"US\"\n12\n      },\n13\n      \"phoneNumbers\": [\n14\n        \"+13065551234\"\n15\n      ],\n16\n      \"emailAddresses\": [\n17\n        \"example@email.com\"\n18\n      ],\n19\n      \"tags\": [\n20\n        \"2021 Christmas Campaign\"\n21\n      ],\n22\n      \"permissionToContact\": true\n23\n    },\n24\n    \"relationships\": {\n25\n      \"businessLocation\": {\n26\n        \"data\": {\n27\n          \"id\": \"AG-123\"\n28\n        }\n29\n      }\n30\n    }\n31\n  }\n32\n}\nSend API Request\nRequest Sample: Shell / cURL\n\nTo obtain a customer ID for sending a review request you can access the customer ID from the data.id field in a 201 Created response or the errors[0].meta.conflictingCustomerId field in a 409 Conflict response.\n\nOur system may require some time to sync a newly created customer for use within other Vendasta products. If you want to send a review request to a newly created customer, you need to include a wait time of 30000 miliseconds (30 seconds) before making a reviews/reviewRequests call.\n\nStep 3: Create a Review Request\nRequest\nExample Response\n\nUsing your generated access token in your Authorization header, the Vendasta customer ID and template IDs you can make a POST request to send a review request. Notice that the ids provided in the request body contain several ids joined together with \":\". For the customer ID add the business ID of the business location you are sending the review request for to the start of your Vendasta customer ID. For the template ID add the business ID as well as the template type (either \"email\" or \"sms\") to the beginning of your template ID.\n\nPOST\nhttps://prod.apigateway.co/products/reviews/reviewRequests\nParameters\nAuthorization*\n:\nContent-Type*\n:\nBody\n1\n{\n2\n  \"data\": {\n3\n    \"type\": \"reviewRequests\",\n4\n    \"relationships\": {\n5\n      \"customer\": {\n6\n        \"data\": {\n7\n          \"id\": \"AG-abc123:CUSTOMER-003c26eb-f940-48c6-a5dc-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n8\n        }\n9\n      },\n10\n      \"primaryTemplate\": {\n11\n        \"data\": {\n12\n          \"id\": \"AG-abc123:sms:TEM-d2f4cf1aa7ae480bbf0a2da67dxxxxxx\"\n13\n        }\n14\n      },\n15\n      \"fallbackTemplate\": {\n16\n        \"data\": {\n17\n          \"id\": \"AG-abc123:email:TEM-d2f4cf1aa7ae480bbf0a2da67dxxxxxx\"\n18\n        }\n19\n      }\n20\n    }\n21\n  }\n22\n}\nSend API Request\nRequest Sample: Shell / cURL"

    "html": "Obtaining an Access Token for a service account\n\nThese directions assume you have already created a service account\n\nCommand Line\n\nIt is generally best to use a library (below) within the same code that you will be writing the rest of your application in. For debugging and using the try it now features of this site you may use our command line tool.\n\nUsing a library\n\nWe recommend using one of the OAuth2 libraries listed at jwt.io to generate your access tokens. Look for one in your preferred programming language that has a green checkmark next to Sign and RS256.\n\nParameters\n\nMost of the parameters that you need to pass into the library can be found in the json file that was downloaded when you created keys for your service account. As a reminder here is what that file looks like:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"c0273fce-79b7-4104-8a8c-ea489abb3979\",\n  \"private_key\": \"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----<private-key>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\",\n  \"client_email\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\",\n  \"token_uri\": \"https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/token\",\n  \"assertionHeaderData\": {\n    \"alg\": \"RS256\",\n    \"kid\": \"c0273fce-79b7-4104-8a8c-ea489abb3979\"\n  },\n  \"assertionPayloadData\": {\n    \"aud\": \"https://iam-prod.apigateway.co\",\n    \"iss\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\",\n    \"sub\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe exact format for providing the parameters will change for each library. Generally, they are broken into assertion header and assertion payload categories.\n\nAssertion Headers Parameters\nalg (AKA Algorithm): Use the value found at the alg key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionHeaderData.\nkid (AKA Key ID): Use the value found at the kid key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionHeaderData.\nAssertion Payload Parameters\n\naud (AKA audience): Use the value found at the aud key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionPayloadData.\n\niat (AKA issued at): The current time as the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch. Most languages include helpers for calculating this.\n\nexp (AKA expiry): We recommend a value of 10 minutes (or less) from the current time. The exp parameter defines the point at which the request to create an access token is no longer valid. This protects against replay attacks. If your library does not have a helper it should be specified as the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch.\n\niss (AKA issuer): Use the value found at the iss key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionPayloadData.\n\nsub (AKA subject): Use the value found at the sub key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionPayloadData.\n\nscope: This parameter should contain a space-separated list of the categories of things you would like the access token to be able to use. Each of the API operations provides a list of scopes. At least one of them must be included here to call that endpoint.\n\nExamples\n\nConfiguring your OAuth2 library will vary, however here are some example implementations which obtains an access token and uses it to call Vendasta's UserInfo endpoint.\n\nNote: these examples assumes you've included your client credential key pair in the current working directory at the path: ./client-credentials.json.\n\nGolang\nC#\nJava\npackage main\n\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\n\t\"golang.org/x/oauth2/jwt\"\n)\n\n\ntype credentials struct {\n\tType         string `json:\"type\"`\n\tPrivateKeyID string `json:\"private_key_id\"`\n\tPrivateKey   string `json:\"private_key\"`\n\tClientEmail  string `json:\"client_email\"`\n\tTokenURI     string `json:\"token_uri\"`\n\tAssertionPayloadData struct {\n\t\tAud string `json:\"aud\"`\n\t\tIss string `json:\"iss\"`\n\t\tSub string `json:\"sub\"`\n\t} `json:\"assertionPayloadData\"`\n}\n\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Read in the downloaded Credential JSON\n\tbytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\"./client-credentials.json\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\t// Parse the JSON credential to access its fields\n\tvar creds credentials\n\terr = json.Unmarshal(bytes, &creds)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\t// Construct the configuration required by the \"golang.org/x/oauth2/jwt\" library\n\toauthConfig := jwt.Config{\n\t\t// The email address of our service account\n\t\tEmail: creds.ClientEmail,\n\t\t// The private key we created\n\t\tPrivateKey: []byte(creds.PrivateKey),\n\t\t// The ID of the private key we created\n\t\tPrivateKeyID: creds.PrivateKeyID,\n\t\t// The JWT's subject is the service account's email\n\t\tSubject: creds.ClientEmail,\n\t\t// A list of scopes which the Access Token will have access to.\n\t\t// We'll request the 'profile' and 'email' scopes\n\t\tScopes: []string{\"profile\", \"email\"},\n\t\t// The provided token URL\n\t\tTokenURL: creds.TokenURI,\n\t\t// Expire the Access Token in 10 minutes\n\t\tExpires: 10 * time.Minute,\n\t\t// The audience of the JWT\n\t\tAudience: creds.AssertionPayloadData.Aud,\n\t\t// We don't need to provide any private claims\n\t\tPrivateClaims: nil,\n\t\t// We need an Access Token, not an ID Token\n\t\tUseIDToken: false,\n\t}\n\n\n\t// Fetch a token from Vendasta using a client assertion\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\ttokenInfo, err := oauthConfig.TokenSource(ctx).Token()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\t// Create a Test Request to Vendasta's UserInfo endpoint\n\tbody := strings.NewReader(\"\")\n\treq, err := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/user-info\", body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\t// Attach our access token using the Authorization header.\n\treq.Header.Add(\"Authorization\", fmt.Sprintf(\"Bearer %s\", tokenInfo.AccessToken))\n\n\n\t// Perform the request\n\tresp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\t// Receive and print out the response\n\trespBytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\n\tfmt.Println(string(respBytes))\n}\nManually\n\nIf you like working in obscure languages or doing things the hard way here is a quick overview of the process. For full details you will need to read the OAuth2 specs yourself.\n\nBuilding a client assertion\n\nThe assertion we'll use to prove our identity to Vendasta's token endpoint is a JWT.\n\nA JWT consists of a header section, a payload section and a signature section.\n\nBuilding the assertion header\n\nThe header of your assertion must contain both the algorithm (alg) with which the JWT is signed, and the id of the private key used to sign it (kid).\n\nBoth of these values may be found within the service account credential JSON file you downloaded in a previous step. Here's an example JWT header prior to encoding:\n\n{\n  \"alg\": \"RS256\",\n  \"kid\": \"c0273fce-79b7-4104-8a8c-ea489abb3979\"\n}\n\nHere's where to find each piece:\n\nalg: Use the value found at the alg key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionHeaderData.\nkid: Use the value found at the kid key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionHeaderData.\nBuilding the assertion payload\n\nNow we must build the assertion's payload. Here's an example payload prior to encoding.\n\n{\n  \"aud\": \"https://iam-prod.apigateway.co\",\n  \"iat\": 1591287394,\n  \"exp\": 1591287994,\n  \"iss\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\",\n  \"sub\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\",\n  \"scope\": \"profile email\"\n}\n\nHere's where to find each piece:\n\naud (AKA audience): Use the value found at the aud key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionPayloadData.\niat (AKA issued at): The time the jwt was issued as the number of seconds\n\nsince the Unix Epoch. Most languages include helpers for calculating this.\n\nexp (AKA expiry): The time when the token should expire as the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch. We recommend a value of 10 minutes (or less) from when the token was issued.\niss (AKA issuer): Use the value found at the iss key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionPayloadData.\nsub (AKA subject): Use the value found at the sub key in your downloaded JSON file's assertionPayloadData.\nscope: Space-separated scopes which should be included on the access token which will be issued. Each of the endpoints will provide a list of scopes. At least one of them must be included here in order to call that endpoint.\n\nNote: The jti claim, which is a client-provided unique identifier for the JWT (typically a UUID) is not yet supported by Vendasta. It will be ignored if provided.\n\nAfter constructing a JSON object representing your claims, you'll need to sign it with your private key.\n\nSigning the client assertion\n\nThe steps required to sign your JWT will vary substantially depending on which language you are working with. Please consult a trusted JWT library in the language of your choice.\n\nEnsure you provide the appropriate headers, use the correct signing algorithm (as specified in your downloaded JSON file) and provide your payload as the JWT's claims.\n\nThe encoded and signed JWT you receive as a result of this process will then be used as your client assertion in the next step.\n\nExchanging your client assertion for an access token\n\nNow that we have a signed client assertion we can provide it to Vendasta's token URL to receive an access token.\n\nWe need to provide this assertion as a parameter to the token URL.\n\nUse your language's provided library to encode the following key-value pairs as form data and set your Content-Type header to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n\ngrant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer\nassertion=<client-assertion> (use the client assertion you built in the previous step)\n\nConstruct a POST request to URI provided in the token_uri field of your downloaded JSON file with the encoded form-data as the body.\n\nHere's an example curl command:\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/token' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n--data-urlencode 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer' \\\n--data-urlencode 'assertion=<your-signed-assertion>'\n\nNote that the <your-signed-assertion> should be replaced with the encrypted set of characters created by signing the json assertion."

If you are unable to see a link to the Administration Panel, please contact your supervisor to obtain the necessary permissions.\n\nNext, click the link to the \"Service Accounts\" panel. If you are unable to see this link, please contact your Vendasta representative.\n\nCreating a Service Account\n\nOn the Service Accounts Screen, we'll need to create a service account. If you are integrating with an existing service account, you may skip to generating a key pair.\n\nFirst, click the \"Create Service Account\" button.\n\nHere you can give the account a title and an ID which will help you to identify the service account in the future. These are primarily for your own benefit, so be as descriptive as you like.\n\nClick the Create button to create the service account and proceed to the Manage Keys screen for the newly created account.\n\nGenerating a key pair\n\nProceed to the \"Manage Keys\" screen for the relevant service account, either by creating a service account as per the previous step, or by clicking the \"Manage Keys\" link in the actions menu for the service account as indicated in the following image:\n\nNow you should see a screen which looks something like the following:\n\nHere's where we'll create a new public/private key-pair for the account.\n\nHere we have a choice between an ES256 Key and a RS256 Key. ES256 is required by some existing Vendasta provided SDKs, however for new integrations we recommend using RS256 keys.\n\nCheck the compatibility of your preferred OAuth2 library, but generally we recommend using RS256 since most libraries support it.\n\nClick \"Generate\" when prompted to download a JSON file containing the key credential.\n\nIt's important to keep this file a secret like you would any password. Also note that once downloaded this file is erased from Vendasta's servers and cannot be downloaded again, if the JSON file is lost, a new key pair will need to be generated.\n\nThe service account credential JSON file you downloaded should look something like this:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"c0273fce-79b7-4104-8a8c-ea489abb3979\",\n  \"private_key\": \"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----<private-key>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\",\n  \"client_email\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\",\n  \"token_uri\": \"https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/token\",\n  \"assertionHeaderData\": {\n    \"alg\": \"RS256\",\n    \"kid\": \"c0273fce-79b7-4104-8a8c-ea489abb3979\"\n  },\n  \"assertionPayloadData\": {\n    \"aud\": \"https://iam-prod.apigateway.co\",\n    \"iss\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\",\n    \"sub\": \"automated-account-creation@partner-service-account.apigateway.co\"\n  }\n}\nCycling Keys\n\nThe public/private keys for a service account can be cycled if for any reason a private key is exposed to the public or is presumed to be compromised. You may also choose to cycle your keys on a regular basis for security purposes.\n\nService accounts support multiple public/private key pairs for this purpose, follow these steps to cycle your key without downtime:\n\nGenerate a new key pair using the instructions above.\nReplace your existing credential file with the new one.\nDeploy all services to ensure all integrations are now using the new key.\nDelete the old key pair from the \"Manage Keys\" screen.\n\nYou may perform these steps at any time, as often as you like. Note that once deleted from the service account a key pair cannot be recovered.\n\nNext Step: Using a service account"

    "html": "Overview\n\nThis guide's goal is to assist the reader in the process of authenticating with Vendasta's standardized OAuth2 integration, specifically the 2-legged OAuth2 flow, also known as the client credential flow, in which a client credential is used to obtain an access token on behalf of a service. Vendasta strives to be in compliance with the OAuth2 spec as much possible. If an inconsistency from the spec is discovered, please notify Vendasta so we can resolve the issue. Vendasta supports the use of a jwt token as a valid client assertion.\n\nThe client credentials do not themselves provide any access to API endpoints, they serve only as a means to acquire access tokens which may be used to access API endpoints.\n\nVendasta provides client credentials to the caller in the form of a public/private key-pair which is associated with a service account.\n\nA service account is a Vendasta user account which is associated with a specific service or automation. Service accounts provide a means to limit the permissions of a service and understand and audit the actions of a service within the system.\n\nYou may think of generating an access token as logging into the system using the private key as your password. After some time that session will expire and you have to authenticate again.\n\nIn order to authenticate against a Vendasta API you will need to accomplish each of the following steps:\n\nCreate a service account for your automation or service.\nGenerate a public/private key-pair for the service account.\nWrite code which performs the following steps to acquire and use an access token, repeating the steps upon expiry of the acquired access token.\nUse the public/private key-pair to generate a client assertion, which is a proof of ownership of the private key.\nExchange the client assertion for an access token by calling Vendasta's token endpoint.\nUse this access token as a bearer token in the Authorization header when calling Vendasta endpoints.\n\nNext: Create a Service Account"

Using the info provided by OAuth2/OpenID Connect's userinfo endpoint or SAML's assertion values is a handy way to skip having the user fill out a sign up form.\n\nThere are however many drawbacks:\n\nUpdates to the user profile, such as changing their name or adding permissions, are not applied until the next time that the user logs in. Users often report this as a bug or get frustrated that they have to log out and back in.\nIf a permission is removed or user account locked within your identity provider the user will continue to be able to use the Vendasta platform until their session expires. (Up to 30 days.)\nIt requires extra processing which can make signing in a slow experience for your users.\nIt requires customization in your identity provider to map user identities to the accounts and platform features they should have access to.\nNew employees or customers in your system are not added to Vendasta until the first time they log into Vendasta. As a result they can't be linked to teams, tasks or other features ahead of time.\nOld users remain in the Vendasta platform until manually cleaned up"

If you have multiple apps it is recommended that you create multiple accounts just like you would for a team of administrators.\n\nService Providers - AKA 3-legged OAuth2 - Allows your app to perform actions on behalf of other users based on their level of access. We support the OpenIDConnect standard. The flow is the same one that is used when connecting an app to your Google or Facebook account. Learn more in this illustrated guide.\n\nUsing either of these options follows the same basic flow\n\nCreate the service - Tell us a little about your service\nCreate a secret for the service - Like setting a password, the key pair allows us confirm your identity\nObtain an Access Token - Just like logging in, you will do this at the start of each session\nInclude Access Token in header of API calls - Authorization: Bearer <access token>\n\nAccess Tokens do expire so you may need to refresh them from time to time.

Well, we are working on the ability for businesses to purchase multiple product subscriptions and then assign them to one or more locations. For seat-based products the subscriptions will be assignable to users. We still have a large amount of work to do to support this but we didn't want to make you switch APIs.\n\n2022-05-18\n\nProposed new resources for managing subscription assignments.\n\n2022-04-12\nAutomations name\n\nIt is now possible to get the name of an automation if you already know it's name.

There is no functional impact to your code.\n\nAddress Fields Reconciled\n\nThe address related fields for the businessLocations resource have been reconciled with the new users resource fields so that they use consistent field names and values.\n\nFor businessLocations the zip has been renamed postalCode to match international best practices. As well the stateCode has been replaced with regionCode which follows the ISO 3166-2 format. To migrate you can simply generate the value as {countryCode}-{stateCode}.\n\nFor users the streetAddress has been renamed line1 and additionalAddress has been renamed line2.\n\nThe old fields will continue to work while the trusted tester partners using them are given a chance to migrate. (Targeting 30 days)\n\n2021-04-19\n\nAdded orders resource along with create, get and list operations.

Where possible for items that have reached GA we will continue to support the item for 2 years between announcing the deprecation and removing it. This time may be shortened for unused items.\n\nRemoved - The item has been sunset and can no longer be used\n\nTo aid in your planning the deprecated date, proposedRemoval date and migration description properties will be added within the OpenAPI specification files under the x-lifecycle property.\n\nOther changes\n\nWe may add new optional fields or valid values at any time. These will be documented in the changelog\n\nAll properties should have clear validation rules in the documentation including data type, min/max length or regular expression. If you find one that is unclear please report this bug in our documentation. Once documented we may loosen the restriction but will not tighten them without warning.\n\nWarning system\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you tell us which fields you are using by including the fields query parameter on every request that returns data. That will allow us to warn you if you are using fields that have been deprecated on a resource."

    "html": "Overview\n\nWelcome to the API Gateway. This service has been designed to allow all our partners access to build on top of the platform using a simple set of REST APIs.\n\nBroken into contexts\n\nOur platform serves many different types of users, each with their own frame of reference. If you ask a sales person to describe the properties of a business vs asking someone in accounting you will get two different answers. This is because each have their own context.\n\nTo aid you in presenting the correct version of similarly named fields we have grouped endpoints by the context in which they should be used.\n\nStable\n\nThe platform is rapidly changing but you should not have to update your integration every few months. Our endpoints are designed to continually evolve instead of making you upgrade versions. Each operation, parameter and model field will have a status assigned to it. We aim to provide 2 years of notice before removal so you have time to migrate.\n\nMore on Versioning\n\nBuilt on standards\n\nWe can all be more efficient when we follow the same way of doing things. When facing a design decision we have opted to follow existing standards instead of defining yet another way.\n\nMost notably we use JSON:API as the default format for requests.\n\nIf you have ideas on how we can support more standards please let us know. We want developers to be able to reuse their favorite tools.\n\nSelf documenting\n\nIn the body of responses you will find links to related actions and helpful details on errors. This is the HATEOAS part of REST that is so often forgotten.\n\nConventions\nAuthentication\n\nEvery request requires an OAuth2 bearer authorization header that was issued by the API Gateway. Learn to create them\n\nLocalization\n\nTranslating the content in the platform is crowed sourced and will improve over time. You are encouraged to provide a list of languages that the user can read using the Accept-Language request header. Web browsers will often set this for you by default. If not set en-US will be used.\n\nWe will pick the most appropriate locale based on the header and available translations. Resource attributes representing an enum will have both an untranslated {attribute}Code and a translated {attribute}Name option. Look for the x-translateable flag in the documentation. Translatable fields are readonly over API.\n\nErrors\n\nThey happen. It is a fact of life but we don't think they should be hard to solve.\n\nWhen an error occurs a 4XX or 5xx HTTP status code will be on the response. The body of the response will also contain a list of more specific error messages.\n\nThe code property will tell you the specific platform error that occurred. You can find a complete list of possible errors for the operation in the x-errors attribute of the documentation.\n\nHTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity\nContent-Type: application/vnd.api+json\n\n\n{\n  \"errors\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"422\",\n      \"code\": \"MalformedRequestBody\",\n      \"title\":  \"Malformed request body\",\n      \"detail\": \"Could not deserialize terms from body: unexpected comma at line 20\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"resourceType\": \"terms\",\n        \"paramValue\": \"unexpected comma at line 20\"\n      },\n      \"links\": {\n        \"about\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/docs/errorTypes/MalformedRequestBody\"\n        },\n        \"docs\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/docs/#operation/get-terms-type\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"status\": \"422\",\n      \"code\": \"QueryParameterBadValue\",\n      \"title\": \"Query parameter value not allowed\",\n      \"source\": { \"parameter\": \"page[size]\" },\n      \"detail\": \"The query parameter 'page[size]' does not support the value 'lastName' for this request.\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"param\": \"page[size]\",\n        \"paramValue\": \"lastName\"\n      },\n      \"links\": {\n        \"about\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/docs/errorTypes/QueryParameterBadValue\"\n        },\n        \"docs\": {\n          \"href\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/docs/#operation/get-terms-type\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nFilters\n\nMost operations that return on a list of data allow you to filter the list using query params in the form of &filter[fieledName1]=value1&filter[sub.fieledName3]=value2.\n\nPaging\n\nAll operations that return a list of data will let you specify a query param of page[limit] to indicate the max number of records you would like returned in a single batch. The body of the response will provide links that you can use to get the next batch without needing to send the filters again. The link will be omitted if not available.\n\n{\n  \"links\": {\n    \"first\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/crm/customers?page[cursor]=abc\",\n    \"prev\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/crm/customers?page[cursor]=hij\",\n    \"self\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/crm/customers?page[cursor]=klm\",\n    \"next\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/crm/customers?page[cursor]=nop\",\n    \"last\": \"https://prod.apigateway.co/crm/customers?page[cursor]=xyz\"\n  }\n}\nDates & times\n\nDates are formatted according to RFC-3339 which is an extension of ISO 8601.\n\nTYPE\tFORM\tEXAMPLE\nDate, hour, minute and second in UTC\tYYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSTZD\t2020-10-28T10:37:23Z\nDate, hour and minute in Saskatoon (UTC-6)\tYYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMTZD\t2020-10-28T4:37-6:00\nDate\tYYYY-MM-DD\t2001-12-25"
